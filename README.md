# Snake Game in Python using Turtle

A simple snake game made in Python using the Turtle library. The controls are either through the arrow key or WASD, and like your average snake game, the game ends when you collide the head with either the body segments or the wall. I made this project to get my feet wet using Python and to practice some of the syntax.
